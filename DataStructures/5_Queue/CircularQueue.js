// Circular Queue

// The size of the queue is fixed and a single block of memory is used as if the first element is connected to the last element
// Also referred to as circular buffer or ring buffer and follows the FIFO principle
// A circular queue will reuse the empty block created during the dequeue operation When working with queues of fixed maximum size, a circular queue is a great implementation choice
// The Circular Queue data structure supports two main operations
//   • Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection
//   • Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection
// Usage - AWS FIFO queue, streaming data packets, playlist
