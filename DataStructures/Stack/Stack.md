# STACK

- NOTE: You can implement the Stack data structure simply using an array
- Stack is `FIRST IN LAST OUT` concept
- Each node has `value` and `next` property
- Each Stack has `top` identifier and `height`
- Stack Methods
  - `pushToStack(value)` - Big O: O(1) (Similar to `unshift` operation)
  - `popStack()` - Big O: O(1)  (Similar to `shift` operation)
